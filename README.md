This program was created to work with both Windows and Linux operating systems.
I tested the program with Windows 11 and Ubuntu 20.04, they both work as expected.
The program works with python 3.8.10+

I created a virtual enviroment for the application but its not useful since I didn't use any external libraries.
To run the application use the following command on ubuntu: 
python3 program.py

After entering your name the application will discover any other computers running the same app within your network.
Upon discovery, the online users will be listed. You can choose a user by their index and send messages to them.
Each message recieve, message send and user discovery will cause re renders. This makes the app display everything almost in real time.

program_udp_broadcast.py is the better and optimized application.

This repository is now obsolete since a better and secure chat application can be found [here](https://github.com/deniz6221/Secure-Socket-Chat).
